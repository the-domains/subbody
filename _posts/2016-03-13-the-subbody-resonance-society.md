Subbody Resonance is
a performance art, philosophy, and healing practice developed by the
Japanese researcher and Butoh dancer Rhizome Lee. In his early
twenties Lee met with Tatsumi Hijikata, the founder of the modern
Japanese performance art called Butoh. He was so impressed by the
experience that he decided to dedicate his life to the research of
Hijikata's work and methods and further develop it.In the beginning
Lee's research was focused on improving his own dance, but in 2004
Lee founded the Himalaya Subbody Butoh School in Dharamsala, India
where he proceeded to teach his findings and continue his line of
research with students from all over the world. By now more that 1000
students have graduated from the Himalaya Subbody School, mostly from
Europe and the USA. Currently the
interest in butoh is growing world wide so it is not surprising that
more and more dancers, actors and body workers from India and other
Asian countries are interested in attending the Subbody School.
Though the school fee is low compared to other similar educations,
many of these potential Asian students cannot afford to attend the
school.To resolve this
situation the Subbody Resonance Society was founded. The purpose of
this society is to collect funds to be able to award scholarships to
selected promising young students.
