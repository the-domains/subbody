            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Subbody Resonance is a performance art, philosophy, and healing practice developed by the Japanese researcher and Butoh dancer Rhizome Lee. In his early twenties Lee met with Tatsumi Hijikata, the founder of the modern Japanese performance art called Butoh. He was so impressed by the experience that he decided to dedicate his life to the research of Hijikata's work and methods and further develop it.</h1><p>In the beginning Lee's research was focused on improving his own dance, but in 2004 Lee founded the Himalaya Subbody Butoh School in Dharamsala, India where he proceeded to teach his findings and continue his line of research with students from all over the world. By now more that 1000 students have graduated from the Himalaya Subbody School, mostly from Europe and the USA. Currently the interest in butoh is growing world wide so it is not surprising that more and more dancers, actors and body workers from India and other Asian countries are interested in attending the Subbody School.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/569328808cb280f1eb8f687345a13102c059e4a4.jpg"></article>]]></description>
